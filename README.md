## next steps

- [ ] Transform paths to bed+material size (maintain aspect ratio)
- [ ] Optimize paths in cases where theres uniform circles or straight lines (instead of going to 100 points sequentially it could be one GCODE command)
- [ ] GCODE generator from positions + config
- [ ] load from + save to config file
- [ ] Create onboarding CLI
- [ ] Write documentation
- [ ] Improve discretization algorithm
- [ ] Add modes (direct cutout, etch, etc)
- [ ] Create presentation
